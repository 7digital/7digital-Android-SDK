# 7digital SDK for Android #

The 7digital Android SDK enables you to you add functionality such as preview streams, music charts and metadata, search and purchasing to your app.

Full SDK documentation is available at http://7digital.github.io/7digital-Android-SDK/apidocs/

## Getting Started ##

1. Register as a developer to get a key and secret at http://developer.7digital.com

2. Clone the repository, which includes a sample app

3. To run the sample app, change the _appKey_ and _appSecret_ in the Constants.java file to your own key and secret.

4. To use the SDK in your app, include the cloned repository as a module in Android Studio. Make sure to compile the 'sdk' module as a dependency.

		dependencies {
			compile project(':sdk')
		}

5. Alternatively, a compiled .aar or .jar is available in the Releases tab.

## Adding Purchasing to Your App ##

To add purchasing simply integrate the 7digital Buy Button. This takes care of the checkout and music download process without sending users away to another site. For an example app, see the [sample 7digital buy button app.](https://github.com/7digital/7digital-android-buy-button-demo)
